# Subtitle Studio

SubStudio is a free software licensed under the GPLv3 license that helps you create subtitles with ease.

SubStudio is built with the Qt framework version 5.15.2 with C++. The project unfortunately cannot be upgraded to Qt6 because Multimedia and MultimediaWidgets are removed in this version and the program is based on them.

The [Qt team said](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/whatsnew60.html#removed-modules-in-qt-6-0) that they will reimplement these in a future version, until then, this project will be compiled with Qt5

The media player SubStudio has needs codecs to be installed. I successfully tested [Pro Video Formats](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2050) on MacOS and [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) on Windows.
