# Subtitle Studio

SubStudio is a free software licensed under the GPLv3 license that helps you create subtitles with ease.

---

SubStudio is built with the Qt framework version 5.15.2 with C++. The embedded media player it has needs codecs to be installed. I successfully tested [Pro Video Formats](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2050) on MacOS and [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) on Windows.
